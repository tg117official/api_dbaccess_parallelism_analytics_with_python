What is Program Structure in Python?
The program structure in Python refers to how a Python program is organizedâ€”the building blocks and
their order that make the code readable, maintainable, and functional.Think of it like a blueprint or
a skeleton of your Python script.

Key Components of Python Program Structure
Component
Description
1. Shebang Line (Optional)
        Used in Linux/Unix to specify interpreter. Example: #!/usr/bin/python3
2. Module Imports
        Importing standard libraries or custom modules.
3. Global Variables / Constants
        Defined at the top for easy configuration.
4. Functions / Classes
        Reusable logic; helps break your code into smaller blocks.
5. main() Function
        Entry point of the program.
6. if __name__ == "__main__" block
        Ensures that main() runs only when script is executed directly.


Typical Python Program Structure
# 1. Module imports
import math

# 2. Global variables/constants
PI = 3.14159

# 3. Function definitions
def area_of_circle(radius):
    return PI * radius * radius

# 4. Main logic wrapped in a function
def main():
    r = float(input("Enter radius: "))
    print("Area:", area_of_circle(r))

# 5. Entry point check
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()


Why use this structure?
    - Clean and modular
    - Makes code reusable (functions/classes)
    - Ensures correct behavior when script is imported vs executed
    - Professional and production-ready layout
