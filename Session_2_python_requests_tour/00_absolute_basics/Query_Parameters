Query Parameters in REST APIs

What Are Query Parameters?
Query parameters are key-value pairs sent in the URL to pass data to the server.
They are appended to the URL after a ? and separated by &.
Commonly used with GET requests to filter, sort, or search data.

Syntax
http://example.com/api/resource?key1=value1&key2=value2
? starts the query string
& separates multiple key-value pairs

Characteristics
Sent in the URL, not in the body.
Visible in the browser (can be bookmarked).
Ideal for non-sensitive, read-only data.
Supports multiple filters or inputs in a single request.

Example Use Cases
URL:
https://httpbin.org/get?name=John&role=Student&batch=May2025

URL
Purpose
https://example.com/news?topic=tech&limit=5 --> Get top 5 news in tech

https://shop.com/search?q=laptop&brand=hp --> Search for HP laptops
https://library.com/books?author=tolkien&sort=year --> Books by Tolkien, sorted by year


Best Practices
- Use query params for filters, searches, sorts
- Don’t send passwords or private info in URLs
- Use & to send multiple values
- Always use ? to begin the query string
- Always validate and sanitize inputs on the server.
