Exercise 1: Flask Session-Based Login â€“ Beginner Friendly

Goal:
- User logs in via URL (GET param)
- Server stores username in session
- Dashboard shows personalized message
- Logout clears the session

Steps :

| Step                           | What It Demonstrates                     |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Visiting `/dashboard` directly | Server is stateless                      |
| Logging in                     | Session is created                       |
| Dashboard access               | Session persists and identifies the user |
| Cookie inspection              | Session ID is stored in client cookie    |
| Logout                         | Session is cleared                       |


- Manually change usernames, logout, and test what happens without logging in.
- This reinforces the stateless nature of HTTP and the importance of sessions.
