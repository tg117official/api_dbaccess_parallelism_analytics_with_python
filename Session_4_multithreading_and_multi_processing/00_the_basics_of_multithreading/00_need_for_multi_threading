When to Use Multithreading

1. I/O-bound Tasks
Use multithreading when your program spends time waiting on external systems like:
File systems
Databases
Networks (e.g. APIs, downloads)
User input

Threads are useful here because while one thread waits, others can continue running.
Use Case Examples:
Downloading multiple files concurrently
Reading/writing large files simultaneously
Crawling web pages or scraping data
Chat applications waiting for multiple client inputs
Making API calls to multiple endpoints at once



2. Interactive Applications (GUI responsiveness)
Multithreading helps keep the user interface responsive by running background tasks separately.
Use Case Examples:
A progress bar updates while a file is being uploaded
Live preview while editing a photo or video
Background spell-checker while typing in a document editor



3. Games and Simulations
Many game engines and real-time simulators use threads for handling:
Physics calculations
Rendering
Input events
Network communication


Use Case Examples:
Thread for rendering graphics
Thread for computing AI/movement logic
Thread for multiplayer communication



4. Concurrent Tasks in Web Servers
Web servers use multithreading to handle many requests simultaneously.

Use Case Examples:
Flask or Django web servers handling requests using WSGI threads
Handling multiple users uploading/downloading files
Managing session tracking or log writing in background



5. Background Monitoring / Logging
When you need to continuously monitor or log something in the background, threads are ideal.

Use Case Examples:
Real-time log capturing from applications
Monitoring resource usage (CPU, RAM)
Tracking system events and alerts



When Not to Use Multithreading in Python
Python's GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) limits multithreading for CPU-bound tasks (e.g., image processing, number crunching).
Use multiprocessing instead when:
You're doing math-heavy operations


You need to leverage multiple cores for full CPU usage
