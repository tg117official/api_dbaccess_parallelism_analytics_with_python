Lambda functions in Python are small anonymous functions that are defined using the
`lambda` keyword. They are often used when you need a simple function for
a short period of time and don't want to define a full-fledged function using
the `def` keyword.

Here's a breakdown of lambda functions:

1. Anonymous:
        Lambda functions are anonymous because they don't have a name like regular
        functions defined using `def`.

2. Syntax:
        The syntax for defining a lambda function is
        `lambda parameters : expression`.
        It can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression.

3. Single Expression:
        Lambda functions are restricted to a single expression,
        which is evaluated and returned.

4. Conciseness:
        Lambda functions are typically used for short, simple operations,
        where defining a regular function would be overkill or cumbersome.

5. Functional Programming:
        Lambda functions are often used in functional programming paradigms, where
        functions are treated as first-class citizens and can be passed around as
        arguments or returned from other functions.

Here's a simple example of a lambda function that adds two numbers:

        add = lambda x, y: x + y
        print(add(5, 3))  # Output: 8


Lambda functions are commonly used in combination with built-in functions
like `map()`, `filter()`, and `sorted()`, where a quick function is needed
for a short operation.
They provide a concise way to create functions without the overhead of defining
a named function.
