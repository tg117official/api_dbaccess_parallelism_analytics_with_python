    Unit testing, often associated with Test-Driven Development (TDD), is a fundamental practice in modern
software development aimed at ensuring individual pieces of code (units) work as intended. Here's an
overview of both concepts:

### Unit Testing

    Unit testing involves testing the smallest testable parts of an application, typically functions or methods,
in isolation from the rest of the system. The goal is to ensure that each unit performs correctly according
to its design specifications.

Key Characteristics of Unit Testing:
- Isolation:
        Units are tested in isolation, without interaction with dependencies like databases, file systems,
        or external services. This isolation is often achieved using mocks or stubs.
- Automation:
        Tests are automated, meaning they can be run quickly and repeatedly without manual intervention.
- Repeatability:
        Tests should produce the same results every time they are run, provided the code hasn't changed.
- Coverage:
        Ideally, tests should cover every possible execution path and set of input values for the unit being tested.

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Test-Driven Development is a software development process that relies heavily on the repetition of a very
short development cycle: first, the developer writes a failing automated test case that defines a desired
improvement or new function; then, they produce the minimum amount of code to pass that test; and finally,
they refactor the new code to acceptable standards.

TDD Cycle:
1. Write a Test : Start by writing a test that defines a function or improvements of a function.
2. Run the Test : Run the test, along with all other tests. At this point, the new test should fail
                 because the feature hasn't been implemented yet.
3. Write Code   : Write the code necessary to pass the test. This code may not be perfect.
4. Run Tests    : Run all tests again. If all tests pass, move on; if they fail, fix the code until they pass.
5. Refactor     : Clean up the new code, applying any improvements needed to ensure it adheres to the
             organization's coding standards.
6. Repeat       : Repeat this cycle for every new feature or improvement.

Benefits of TDD:
- Improved Code Quality: Writing tests first requires thinking through the design before writing the code, \
  which can lead to better-designed, cleaner, and more maintainable code.

- Regression Protection: As new features are added or existing features are modified, tests can quickly
  catch regressions in functionality.

- Documentation: Tests serve as documentation for the expected behavior of the system.

- Confidence: Developers can make changes or refactor code more confidently since tests will reveal if
  something breaks.
