ENGINE = InnoDB clause in the CREATE TABLE command specifies the storage engine for the table in
MySQL. Here's a breakdown of its significance and whether it's compulsory or optional:

Significance of InnoDB

Transactions:
        InnoDB supports transactions, which means it allows you to commit and roll back changes. This is
        essential for maintaining data integrity, especially in applications where multiple database
        operations must be treated as a single logical unit.

Row-Level Locking:
        InnoDB uses row-level locking rather than table-level locking, reducing contention and allowing
        more users to access the table simultaneously without performance degradation.

Foreign Key Constraints:
        InnoDB supports foreign keys, which help maintain referential integrity by allowing you to enforce
        relationships between tables.

Crash Recovery:
        InnoDB provides automatic crash recovery that helps protect data integrity in the event of a system
        crash.

Data Consistency:
        InnoDB includes features like consistent nonlocking reads, which can increase performance by
        allowing queries to run without locking at the row level.

Compulsory or Optional?
Optional:
        Specifying ENGINE = InnoDB is optional. If you do not specify it, MySQL will use the default storage
        engine defined in the server configuration. As of MySQL 5.5 and later, the default storage engine is
        InnoDB. If you're using an older version or the configuration has been changed to a different default,
        you might need to specify InnoDB explicitly if you require its features.

When to Specify: You should specify ENGINE = InnoDB if:

You need features such as transaction handling, row-level locking, or foreign key constraints that are not
supported by other engines.The default storage engine on your MySQL server is not InnoDB, and you want to
ensure that your table is created with InnoDB-specific features.
