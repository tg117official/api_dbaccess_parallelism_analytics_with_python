# In Python, pass is a null statement,
# meaning it does nothing when it's executed.
# It's typically used as a placeholder in situations
# where a statement is syntactically required
# but you don't want to execute any code.


# Example 1: Placeholder in a function
def some_function():
    # I'll add code later
    pass

# Example 2: Placeholder in a conditional statement
x = 10
if x < 5:
    # Handle the case when x is less than 5
    pass
else:
    # Handle the case when x is greater than or equal to 5
    print("x is greater than or equal to 5")

# Example 3: Placeholder in a loop
for i in range(5):
    # Do something with i
    # print(i)
    # Placeholder for future code
    pass

print("Hello")
# Example 4: Placeholder in a class
class MyClass:
    # Define class methods later
    pass
